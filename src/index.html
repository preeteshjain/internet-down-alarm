    <h1>Internet Status Alarm - A simple internet "down-or-not" alert tool</h1>
    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>
      This is simple webpage that checks whether your internet is working or not
      every 5 seconds. If in case your internet goes down, it notifies you with
      a sound message.
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Use this tool when you have to download a very large file but you are on
      an unstable internet connection. You might want to be notified immediately
      once the internet is down so you can check where's the problem, fix and
      resume the download immediately. This basically saves you the frustration
      of coming back to your computer after few hours or so, only to realize
      your internet went down during the download.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the <a href="#logs">logs from this tool</a> to show your ISP that your
      internet is not working properly.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Please make sure your speakers are on and the volume is at suitable
        level. Use the sound test below to adjust the volume accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave this page running in your browser. You will be notified if your
        internet goes down. You will also be notified once it is back up.
      </li>
    </ol>
